A little example of how to get IOPlatformSerialNumber with IOKit

Why, I don't know but technically its the fasted methodology I have seen.

time ./serial 
CXXXXXXXXXXX

real	0m0.024s
user	0m0.004s
sys	0m0.007s

time /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | awk '/Serial Number/ {print $NF}'
CXXXXXXXXXXX
real	0m0.446s
user	0m0.141s
sys	0m0.166s

I am learning how to use IOKit at the moment so this guy has some cousins

Known Issues:

CFShow write to standard error so if you wanted to use this in a shell use

declare -x SERIAL=$(./serial 2>&1)
